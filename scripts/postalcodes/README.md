- download and extract ine data set (see ine.py)
- Configure the psql in dbconfig
- Run cps.py to get a first set of cp's. This will generate:
	- allcups.tsv: The list of all cups grouped by postal code - ine code values in the database (cached for the next runs) 
	- report.yaml: the classification of cases
	- solved.yaml: a map of ids with the CP that could be obtained by a simple guess
	- unsolved.yaml: a list of unsolved ids 
- Run either cpbycadaster.py or cpbycensus.py to see how they try to solve cases in unsolved.yaml (generated by cps')
	- contractaddreses.tsv: the relation of addresses for the unsolved.yaml ids (cached for the next run)
	- TODO: By the moment no guess is done just outputs the results for verification
